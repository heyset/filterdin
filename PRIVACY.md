We don't collect any of your personal data.

Because we don't collect it, we can't store it or send it somewhere.

In fact, there's not even a database anywhere, so we couldn't store it even if we collected it.

Of course, whatever you type in as a filter will be stored in your extension's storage, which may or may not be encrypted.
You're not planning on typing your credit card number there, right?
