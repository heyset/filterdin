## How to contribute?

### With code or documentation
Clone the project. Have a look around.
See if you can do something to improve it.
Fork it, make your changes, open a PR.

### By helping people
We have a Discussions forum. If there are people asking things there, answering is a good way to help.

### By flagging issues

Please be as descriptive as possible.

## Guidelines
* Don't be an asshole
* If it's documentation:
  * Well written, please. Try to avoid grammatical mistakes.
  * If you find errors, you can open a PR to correct them. Thank you!
* If it's code:
  * If it's source, TypeScript.
  * Add tests with your submission. I know we don't have tests for everything, but from the moment it became open source, we need them.
  * Test manually in all browsers to make sure it still works properly.
  * Try to make it clean.
